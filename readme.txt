= What percentage of my sales does Cyber Sprocket keep? =

None.  Everything you earn through this plugin is yours, we don't siphon off any of your sales or earn anything outside of our one-time $5 license fee.

= How do I get my Cafepress API Key? =

Sign up at <a href="http://developer.cafepress.com/">Developer.cafepress.com</a> and fill out the Register My Application form.  It takes less than 5 minutes and is easier than setting up your original Cafepress store.
